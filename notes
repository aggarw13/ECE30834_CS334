Procedure for Island generation:

1. Generate random points
	Parameters:
	a. number of points
	b. distribution: Grid, randomize, spiral
	c. LLoyd relaxation: apply or not
2. Generate voronoi polygons
3. Hill points generation
	a. Select points
	b. intensity of darkness of area (darkness == elevation value) decrease linearly and radially from the center of the points
	c. Equation: (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r where  r = distance from center, (a,b) is the center coordinate of the circle
4. Devise algorithm to detect areas of potential lakes.
5. User input for starting point rivers
	a. using the elevation values and the edges of the polygons, calculate the highest slope gradient downwards for where the rivers will flow into.
